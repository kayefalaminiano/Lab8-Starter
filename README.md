**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**

Graceful degradation and service workers both aim to ensure a smooth user experience despite varying browser capabilities or network conditions. Graceful degradation starts with a full-featureed app and adjusts for less capable environments while service workers enhance this by handling all background tasks like caching and network requests, which ensure that the main app remains function and can perform even under poor conditions.
